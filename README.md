## What is This?
This is a smal, stupid website i build to let my Friends download Minecraft modpacks so that i wouldn't have to upload them to Modrinth & Curseforge as both take a different ammount of time to approve new Version.

It would likely have been easyer to just send them the links to the download directly.

If you found this by Acident, i recomend leaving.
